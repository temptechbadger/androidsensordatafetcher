### Setup:

- install via Android Studio

- manually enable location permission via system settings

- if the location file remains empty, be sure to open google maps at least once, and have optimized location available
- 
to stop the tracking, manually close the active app via the top-down system menu

files are located inside the Downloads directory, namely sensor.csv and location.csv

stopping and restarting the app clears the files, so move the files before doing so!
